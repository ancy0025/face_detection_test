# Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed using the Haar Cascade Classifier.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python

Dependencies
cv2 (OpenCV)

Usage
Ensure a webcam is connected to your device.

Run the script:
bash

python face_detection.py

The webcam feed will open, displaying rectangles around detected faces.

Press q to quit the application.

How It Works
Loads Haar Cascade Classifier: Uses OpenCV's pre-trained haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml for frontal face detection.

Captures Webcam Feed: Accesses the default webcam (index 0).

Processes Frames:
Converts each frame to grayscale for better detection.

Detects faces using detectMultiScale with a scale factor of 1.1 and minimum neighbors of 5.

Draws Rectangles: Draws green rectangles around detected faces.

Displays Output: Shows the live feed with face detections in a window titled "Face Detection Test".

Exits Gracefully: Stops on pressing q and releases resources.

Notes
The Haar Cascade file is included with OpenCV. Ensure cv2.data.haarcascades points to the correct path.

Adjust scaleFactor and minNeighbors for better detection accuracy depending on lighting and distance.

Requires a working webcam and sufficient lighting for optimal performance.

Troubleshooting
Webcam not found: Check webcam connection or try a different index (e.g., 1 instead of 0).

Cascade file not found: Verify OpenCV installation and Haar Cascade file availability.

Lag or low performance: Reduce frame resolution or adjust scaleFactor/minNeighbors.
